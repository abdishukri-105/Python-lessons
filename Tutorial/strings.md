 # Strings

 Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

## Multiline Strings

You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

## Strings are Arrays

Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

## Looping Through a String

Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

 # Python - Slicing Strings

 ou can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

   ```
     b = "Hello, World!"
     print(b[2:5])
